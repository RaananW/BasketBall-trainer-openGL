# Basketball Trainer / OpenGL Project #

The project started around June 2009 as a university project. The goal was to write an OpenGL program with under 1200 lines of code (not including textures and maps, of course).

I am releasing the source code and windows binaries to the public, hoping someone learning OpenGL can benefit from it. 
I am not stating any "license" under which this is released, but I am expecting a certain credit if the code is somehow used.

I am aware of the fact the code is 99% NOT commented, i will do my best to slowly add comments to main parts of the code.

## A bit about the basketball trainer ##

1. The idea was to allow a "player" to throw a ball into a basket and present the ball's track in a replay mode.
2. Collision detection had to be implemented, so the ball will "jump" off the ring in a correct manner. Gravity is also set, so the ball is actually jumping correctly.
3. If you look throughout the code you might find some traces of "player 1, player 2" functions. this was planned to be a multi-player game, but the lack of time (and need) won.
